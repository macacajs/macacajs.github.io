# NoSmoke Automated UI Crawler

A cross platform UI crawler which scans view trees then generate and execute UI test cases. For full set of documentation, please refer to:
[wiki](https://github.com/macacajs/NoSmoke/wiki)

## 1. Advantages of NoSmoke:

With it you can:

* [x] **Automated UI test** with simple configuration
* [x] **More accurate than monkey test** with view tree crawling
* [x] **Multiple platforms** iOS, Android and Web !! :\]
* [x] **Testing result visualisation** via [Macaca-Reporter](https://github.com/macacajs/macaca-reporter)

## 2. How it works?

In order to design a multiplatform UI automation tool, the overall architcture is devided into 3 different layers.

* The **Proxy** layer, which are tester drivers wrapping local platform testing tool like UIAutomator, XCUITest. They establishes sockets which recieve and executes requests in format of [web driver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) protocol.
* The **Macaca-Server** layer, which are node server created on PC. It provides a set of cli-command based on which users can install the testing app and init the proxy on a specific device. Further it routes http request to proxies in various platforms.
* The **NoSmoke** layer, it contains a node client which posting various crawling and analysis commands to **Macaca-Server** layer. The crawling algorithm in this module utilizes the node client to fetch window sources and convert it to a DFS tree model, then eventually send out a UI action to the target app via **macaca-server** and **proxy**.

## 3. Why the name?

Since all the good ones are taken, `NoSmoke` comes from the ideas across `smoke testing`, but smoke is not good for health ...

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Muliplatform

NoSmoke supports UI crawling and testing for **iOS**, **Android** and **PC Web**, [macaca-reporter](//github.com/macacajs/macaca-reporter) is used to gather and present the crawling process. During the execution of nosmoke, the current page and relevent action info will be revealed on reporter:

## 5. Setup

### 5.1. Requirements:

* iOS simulator 11.0 and xcode 9.0 and above.
* Android 6.0 and above, supporting both device and simulator. For real device testing please install null-keyboard

**Note** You could also check environment by `macaca doctor`:

```bash
$ npm i macaca-cli -g
$ macaca doctor
```

### 5.2. Setup & Run:

##### **Step 1.** Setup:

Full list of dependencies:

```bash
$ npm i macaca-android -g
$ npm i macaca-ios -g
$ npm i macaca-cli -g
$ npm i macaca-electron -g
```

Install nosmoke in a single line:

```bash
$ npm i nosmoke -g
```

##### **Step 2.** Run it:

In your workspace directory, execute the following command

```bash

# initialize macaca server
macaca server --verbose &

# initialize nosmoke
nosmoke
```

**Note:** For full set of command please check: `nosmoke --help` <br/>
**Note:** Invoking nosmoke itself will simply run the default demo application. To run your own application, you should put -h \(which is optional\) and -c \(the path of the configuration file is a must\) in order to run the crawler
